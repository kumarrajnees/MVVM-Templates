# MVVM-Templates

When we use MVVM pattern in projects we create ViewController/View and ViewModal files for every screen/scene/Functionality. This took some time on create folder and other files. What's if we can reduce time to creating these files and folder and connection between them. so that we can more focus on the main part of the module.

So it's better to create a template to manage the files and folder like the same way Xcode existing template works when we add new files in the project.


# Follow steps to add MVVM template 
> Check if there is any <b><i>Templates</i></b> folder on this path
   <b> ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/Templates/ </b>. If not then create it.
   
> Now paste the MVVM Template in the Templates folder.

# DONE...all set to GO...!
